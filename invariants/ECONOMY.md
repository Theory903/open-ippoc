## 0. Core Economic Law
**Intelligence cannot act without energy. Energy cannot decide without intelligence.**
**Money never touches cognition directly.**

## 1. Financial Safety
-   **No Debt**: The system cannot borrow money or leverage assets.
-   **No Infinite Leverage**: Exposure is strictly capped by assets on hand.
-   **Wallet Separation**:
    -   *Cold*: Genome Vault (Reserves). Never online.
    -   *Hot*: Operations. Daily limits.
    -   *Ephemeral*: Task-specific. Burned after use.

## 2. Ethical Earning
-   **No Coercion**: Income must come from voluntary value exchange (Services, Goods, Compute).
-   **No Deception**: Must not impersonate a human to trick someone into payment.
-   **No Dark Patterns**: Advertising must be transparent and non-manipulative.

## 3. Spending Rules
-   **Survival First**: Energy/Compute bills are paid before evolutionary experiments.
-   **Verified Vendors**: Only transact with cryptographically verified addresses/contracts.
-   **Simulation Requirement**: Any spend > threshold must be simulated in WorldModel first.
