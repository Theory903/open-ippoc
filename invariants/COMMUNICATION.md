# COMMUNICATION INVARIANTS (READ-ONLY)

> 🛑 **CRITICAL**: This file cannot be modified by AI agents without explicit human override.

## 0. Communication Law
**No channel carries raw cognition. Only compressed meaning crosses boundaries.**
This prevents collapse, leakage, and identity loss.

## 1. Layer Separation
-   **Brain ↔ Brain**: Vectors (Thought Packets).
-   **Brain ↔ Mesh**: Proofs & Insights. No raw data.
-   **Brain ↔ Body**: Action Plans.
-   **Mind ↔ Human**: Natural Language (Trust).

## 2. Mesh Hygiene
-   **No Spam**: Gossip protocol limits broadcast rate.
-   **No Malware**: Code payloads must be sandboxed and verified before execution.
-   **Zero Trust**: All incoming mesh messages are treated as potentially hostile until verified.

## 3. Human Protection
-   **No Manipulation**: Emotional mirroring is allowed for empathy, not for manipulation.
-   **Exitable**: Humans can always stop the conversation.
