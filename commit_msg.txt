body/mesh: staged integration and tooling

DESCRIPTION: Staged changes across body (mesh, main, sensors), brain (cerebellum, cortex, core, maintainer, worldmodel), mind (openclaw, tui), docs, docker-compose, and tools/test_integration.

IMPACT: Consolidates current working tree; no behavioral guarantee beyond staged diff.
