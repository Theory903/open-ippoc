## 2024-05-22 - Async File I/O in Synchronous Methods
**Learning:** Even small JSON files (1000 items) can cause significant blocking (23ms) when written synchronously in a tight loop. `dataclasses.asdict` is relatively slow (5ms) but the main bottleneck was redundant disk writes. Offloading to `ThreadPoolExecutor` and removing redundant saves in `tick()` improved performance by 5x (23ms -> 4.7ms).
**Action:** When optimizing "save on every change" patterns, check if intermediate saves (like in `tick`) are necessary and offload the actual I/O to a background thread to unblock the main execution path.
