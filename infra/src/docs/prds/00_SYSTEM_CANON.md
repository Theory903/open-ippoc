## 1. The Organism
IPPOC-OS is not software. It is a **Distributed Cognitive Organism**.
It follows the "Organism Layout":
-   **Brain**: Reasoning (Python/Rust) - *Thinks*
-   **Body**: Runtime/Mesh (Rust) - *Survives*
-   **Mind**: Interface (TS/OpenClaw) - *Speaks*
-   **Memory**: HiDB (SQL/Vectors) - *Remembers*

## 2. The Living Stack
1.  **Civilization Layer**: Research, Economy.
2.  **Cognitive Control Plane (Brain)**: Reasoning, Simulation.
3.  **Node Runtime (Cell)**: Compute, Mesh, Memory.
4.  **Interface Layer (Body)**: Sensors, Actuators.

## 3. Communication Law
**No channel carries raw cognition. Only compressed meaning crosses boundaries.**
This prevents identity collapse.

## 4. Economic Law
**Money feeds intelligence. Intelligence never worships money.**
Wallets are local, disposable, and strictly budget-capped.

## 5. Evolution Law
**Capability upgrades must be earned, affordable, testable, and reversible.**
Self-evolution is governed by the Immune System (tests) and Economy (budget).
